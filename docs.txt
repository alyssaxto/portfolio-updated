hey
i did the stuff with docker - docker helps because it maskes it where we work on the same version of python, node etc
also installs all dependencies you need automatically 

you might need to install docker desktop 
https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/

to get the server running, do
docker-compose up --build
do this from the main folder, dont cd into backend or frontend or anywhere

it should take a while the first time, then it will be faster after
visit https://localhost:4280
once the server is running! this way u dont have to have multiple terminals open and its easier for u i hope
